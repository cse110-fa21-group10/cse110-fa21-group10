# Redesign Philosophy ADR 

Focus on visibility and contrast. Colors are used to create distinctions and draw attention to central areas. We thought about a dark theme website, but apparently that's bad for usability and it's easier to read. 

We tried to use a consistent uneven dual column setup for both the recommendation page as well as the recipe page.
