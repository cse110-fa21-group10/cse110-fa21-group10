# Design Philosophy ADR 
(Copied from Miro)

# Context and Problem Statement

We want to build our product modularly such that we can continually add features, but stop at any point and begin polishing. Longer term ideas are split into much smaller subsections that can be used as a final product if time does not permit the entire section. In addition, our product will focus on minimalism, moreso focusing on what is considered to be *core* and putting the most time into this segment. 

# Reasons for Options

The main purpose of this design philosophy is to set definite goals, reduce feature bloat, and give the team more flexibility based on variability of our time-frame. Additional features should be heavily scrutinized, as they often lead to more problems than they solve.
