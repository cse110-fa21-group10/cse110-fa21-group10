# 113021-retrospective

## Things we did poorly
- communication
- setting goals, tasks
- figuring out what we wanted our product to look like
- creating a clear roadmap and next steps


## Things we can do to help us
- need more mini-updates
- utilize the github projects page more (see what other people are working on)
- having more specific allocations of assignments

### Planning to have more meetings this week to address necessary changes
