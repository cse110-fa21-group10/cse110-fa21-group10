- appetite
	- add milestones
	- "in two weeks, we want to"

- include a bit more about our research
	- one or two slides of our research

- not using database
	- strictly using APIs
	
Tech stack
- don't use unnecessary stuff
- no react no angular
- try to restrict your usage to the basic css/js and stuff from labs
- if we want to add some more, we should ask TA to know what's allowed
	- they dont want students to use a bunch of frameworks if it's not necessary
