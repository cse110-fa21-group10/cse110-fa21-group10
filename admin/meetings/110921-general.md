- we're making good progress, in a good spot

- 4 assignments on canvas
	- kind of misleading with due dates, these 4 assignments have checkpoints with earlier due dates
	- ADR
		- make as many as possible, prob like 7+ by the end of the project
	- sprint retrospective
	- CI/CD pipeline, like in lecture
		- C4 diagram 
		
- next discussion (or some discussion) is going to make something like a progress report
	- kind of like the project pitch, supposed to get questions and feedback
	- just have all the stuff we've done so far ready in some slides or something
	
- mihir
	- question: how do we safely store an api key and use it
	- github secrets is pretty cool
	- TA: a lot of APIs exist and they would have to deal with this problem, so there's prob a lot of good solutions.
