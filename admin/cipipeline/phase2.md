# CI/CD Pipeline - Phase 1

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to record decisions and progress for our plans for ending phase of Continuous Integration and Delivery

## Currently everything that is implemented

* Github actions
* Eslint
* Jsdoc
* Codacy
* Jest
* Puppeteer
* Firebase

## What still needs to be implemented

* unit test cases
* end-to-end test cases

## Implemented features' functionality 

### Github actions

* Used to run all our other components, so a continuous integration and deployment system

### Eslint

* Code style guide check to make sure code pushed are all similar to one antoher

### Jsdoc

* Javascript code documentation so others know what different code does

### Codacy

* Code quality check

### Jest & Puppeteer

* Used to test code and make unit tests and end-to-end test cases

### Firebase

* Place to deploy our app

## How we plan to complete our uncompleted tasks

### Unit/End-To-End Test cases

* For the unit and end-to-end test cases we haven't been able to implement them due to the backend and front end not being finished. But now they're we're at the basic deployed state of our project, we can start doing that.
